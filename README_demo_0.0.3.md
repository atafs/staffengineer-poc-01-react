# Release Notes: Web React PoC (May 28, 2025)

## Version: Enhanced PoC

### Overview

This release enhances the Web React Proof of Concept (PoC) for the Image Recognition App, incorporating new sections, UI improvements, and a footer component. All changes were made within a 30-minute time box per enhancement, focusing on improving structure, presentation, and user experience.

### Enhancements

1. **Added Sections for Document Structure** (2025-05-28)

   - **Description**: Integrated six sections (1–6) into `MainContent.js` to align with the original document's placeholders ("Separador 2" to "Separador 6"). Section 1 was later designated as "Image Recognition App."
   - **Details**:
     - Sections 2–6 include placeholder content for "Feature Overview," "Technical Details," "Use Cases," "Future Enhancements," and "Feedback."
     - Styled with Tailwind CSS (`bg-white`, `p-6`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-md`) for consistency.
   - **Impact**: Provides a structured layout, making the PoC more representative of the intended design.

2. **Integrated Image Recognition UI into Section 1** (2025-05-28)

   - **Description**: Moved the core image recognition UI (`<h1>`, `ImageUpload`, `Reset` button, `ResultsDisplay`) into Section 1 of `MainContent.js`.
   - **Details**:
     - Updated the `sections` array to render the UI as JSX content for Section 1.
     - Preserved all functionality (image upload, mock API, state management).
   - **Impact**: Centralizes the app’s main feature within the sectioned structure, improving organization.

3. **Applied Light Blue Background to Section 1 UI** (2025-05-28)

   - **Description**: Added a light blue background to the `<div>` containing the image recognition UI in Section 1.
   - **Details**:
     - Changed `bg-white` to `bg-blue-100`, then updated to `bg-blue-200` for a slightly darker shade.
     - Maintained other Tailwind classes (`w-full`, `max-w-md`, `p-6`, `rounded-lg`, `shadow-md`, `mb-8`).
   - **Impact**: Enhances visual appeal with a cohesive color scheme, maintaining readability.

4. **Added Footer Component** (2025-05-28)

   - **Description**: Created a new `Footer.js` component and integrated it into `MainContent.js`.
   - **Details**:
     - Added a footer with a copyright notice and a link, styled with `bg-gray-200`, `p-4`, `text-center`, `text-gray-700`, and `mt-8`.
     - Included a header in the footer (`<h1>`) with `bg-blue-200` to match Section 1’s aesthetic.
   - **Impact**: Completes the page layout with a professional footer, enhancing the PoC’s polish.

5. **Updated Footer Link to Dark Blue** (2025-05-28)
   - **Description**: Changed the link color in `Footer.js` to a darker blue.
   - **Details**:
     - Updated the `<a>` tag’s `className` from `text-blue-600` to `text-blue-800` for the link to Neurolabs.
     - Retained `hover:underline` for interactivity.
   - **Impact**: Improves link visibility and contrast, aligning with the app’s visual theme.

### Known Issues

- Placeholder content in Sections 2–6 requires replacement with real data for production use.
- The mock API in `MainContent.js` is for demonstration only; integration with a real API (e.g., xAI’s API at https://x.ai/api) is planned.

### Future Improvements

- Replace placeholder section content with detailed information.
- Enhance the footer with additional links or interactive elements.
- Integrate a real image recognition API for production-ready functionality.
- Add visual aids, such as charts for confidence scores, using Matplotlib or a React charting library.

### Notes

- All enhancements were completed within 30-minute time boxes to ensure rapid iteration.
- The PoC assumes functional `ImageUpload` and `ResultsDisplay` components; further refinements may be needed based on their implementation.
- For API integration, refer to https://x.ai/api for xAI’s offerings.
